A cute little game made in LOVE that has you play a character that can write in her journal and enjoy the company of her cat.

# MEIMEI'S JOURNAL

Welcome to MEIMEI'S JOURNAL, a small, personal project I created to explore game development, pixel art, and animation. This is a cozy little game that I made to experiment with my first attempts at pixel art and game design. The focus of the game is to provide a calm and relaxing space where you can write, unwind, and enjoy some cute pixel charm.

 About the Game

You get to interact with a tiny, charming pixel girl character that I designed and animated entirely by myself. This was my first experience creating pixel art, and it was both challenging, nerve-wrecking, and fun. I learned how to design and animate characters at the pixel level, which meant carefully considering how every single pixel contributes to the overall look of my character.

One of the most fun and tricky parts of this project was creating the character sheet for animation. I had to adjust poses, movements, and details multiple times to make sure that the animations felt smooth while keeping the cute and simple aesthetic intact. It was a learning process of trial, error, and lots of tiny pixel adjustments, but seeing the character move naturally in the game made it all worth it.

Alongside the character, I also created a cozy little pixel house as the environment for the game. Building the house taught me how to design static backgrounds that complement a character’s animations while still feeling warm, welcoming, and visually appealing.

 Journal Feature

A central feature of the game is the **journal**. Players can type their own journal entries directly in the game. The goal was to provide a relaxing, cute and playful experience where you can write freely while enjoying the calming aesthetic of pixel art.

The journal is accompanied by **soft lo-fi music**, designed to create a comforting atmosphere. It’s the perfect background for reflection, creativity, or just unwinding after a long day. To make the experience even cozier, there is a **cute kitten companion** that sits nearby while you write. The kitten is a game asset I included to add warmth and companionship to the scene, giving the game a sense of life and personality.

Learning Pixel Art and Animation

This project was a huge learning experience for me. I had never created pixel art before, just regular digital art, and through this project, I learned a lot about:

Pixel-level design: Every pixel counts when creating characters, objects, and backgrounds. I learned how to simplify shapes while keeping them readable and appealing.

Animation basics: Creating the character sheet and animating movement taught me how to break down actions into frames and how timing affects the fluidity of motion.

Art adjustments: I made countless adjustments to colors, proportions, and spacing to make sure everything looked right when animated.

Game development details: From programming the journal interface to integrating music and assets, I learned the small but crucial details that make a game feel polished and functional.

These lessons not only improved my pixel art skills but also helped me understand how much planning and care goes into making even a simple, cozy game.

# Gameplay

The main gameplay loop is simple:

1. Enter your journal entry.
2. Listen to calming lo-fi music.
3. Watch your cute pixel girl and kitten in their cozy environment.
4. Relax and enjoy the cute atmosphere.

There are no timers, scores, or stressful objectives. The game is all about slowing down, focusing on creativity, and enjoying the little details of my art and animation.

Features
* Cute, self-made pixel girl character with animated movement.
* Cozy pixel house environment.
* Interactive journal where players can type their thoughts.
* Lo-fi music for a relaxing vibe.
* Adorable kitten companion for comfort and charm that meows when you click it.
* First-person experience of creating pixel art and animation in a game.

Lessons Learned

Creating this game taught me a lot about the creative and technical parts of game development:

* Attention to small visual details is essential, especially in pixel art.
* Animation requires patience, observation, and repeated tweaking(A LOT ).
* Simple interactive elements (like a journal) can greatly enhance player immersion.
* Combining sound, visuals, and interaction creates a comforting atmosphere.
* Even a small project can teach meaningful lessons about art and coding.

This project also reinforced my love for creating cozy, relaxing experiences in games and inspired me to continue improving my skills in both art and development.

How to Play

1. Download the repository or the compiled `.love` file.
2. Open the game with the **LOVE framework** (available at [https://love2d.org](https://love2d.org)).
3. Start typing your journal entry and enjoy the cozy experience.

Final Thoughts

Thanks to CS50 for the chance to make this game. It's more than just a game—it’s a reflection of my little journey as a beginner computer science. From learning the basics of pixel animation to building a comforting little space, this project represents growth, patience, and the joy of creating something for yourself.

I hope that when you play this game, you feel the same calm, cozy/cute vibes I felt while making it. Whether you’re writing, relaxing, or just making the pixel characters move, I wanted to create a little digital space where you can slow down and enjoy the simple pleasures of a tiny, charming world.

Thank you for checking out my little goofy game, and I hope it brings a little happiness and comfort to your day.
